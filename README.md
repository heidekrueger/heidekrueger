I'm a CS PhD student at TU Munich, doing research at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory and Market Design.
In my research, I'm interested in the application of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning methods to compute market equilibria, especially in auctions, and the mathematical underpinnings this entails. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist in the telecomunications industry after earning my MSc and BSc degrees in applied Mathematics.

My expected graduation date for my PhD program is Summer/Fall 2022. After that I will be looking for Research Scientist / Research Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist positions. My ideal job would entail working with a world-class team to solve challenging large-scale technical problems.

You can follow me [@hkrgr](https://twitter.com/hdkrgr), or connect with [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidekrueger/) on LinkedIn.

Most of my recent coding projects live in private repositories, but more and more of them should appear here soon.

### My Stack

I'm passionate about (and have long-term professional experience) the following frameworks:

* `pytorch` for deep learning (and other GPU-accelerated scientific computing).
* The `tidyverse` in `R` for data analysis, vizualisation and statistical programming.
* `python` for general software development.

In the past, I've also worked on Big Data with `spark` and `scala`, written code in `Java`, `C#` and `C++`, as well as some simulations with `MATLAB`.
