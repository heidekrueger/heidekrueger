## Hi, I'm Stefan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS PhD student at TU Munich, doing research at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory and Market Design.
In my research, I'm interested in the application of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning methods to compute market equilibria, especially in auctions, and the mathematical underpinnings this entails. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist in the telecomunications industry after earning my BSc and MSc degrees in applied Mathematics.

My expected graduation date for my PhD program is Fall/Winter 2022. After that I will be looking for Research Scientist / Research Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist positions in industry or Postdoc research opportunities at the intersection of AI, ML, Economics and Incentive Design.

## My Stack

I'm passionate about (and have long-term professional experience) the following frameworks:

* `pytorch` for deep learning (and other GPU-accelerated scientific computing).
* The `tidyverse` in `R` for data analysis, vizualisation and statistical programming, as well as `mlr3` and `tidymodels` for meta-ml in R. 
* `python` for general software development.

In the past, I've also worked on deep learning with `TensorFlow`, Big Data with `spark` and `scala`, and written general-purpose code in `Java`, `C#` and `C++`, as well as some simulations with `MATLAB`. 

I would love to check out the following cool technologies in more detail, but haven't yet had a chance to work with them extensively: `JAX` for differential programmin; the `julia` project for statistical computing; Smart contract development via Selenium, ChiaLisp or Rust/Solana. 


### If you're a potential employer who wants to see my code:

Most of my current coding projects live in private repositories over on https://gitlab.lrz.de/heidekrueger, but I'm hoping to release more of them here soon.
My primary programming project in my PhD research (together with my collaborators) is _bnelearn_, a python package for equilibrium learning (and evaluation) in auctions. An initial public version (containing minimal code to reproduce results in our recent _Nature Machine Intelligence_ publication) is available [here](https://github.com/heidekrueger/bnelearn), but that repo currently lacks documentation for political reasons. We will release a full version with a high-level user API and complete documentation very soonâ„¢.

In the meantime, I encourage you to also check out [my solutions](https://github.com/heidekrueger/f00b4r-Challenge) ot Google's semi-secret foo-bar recruiting challenge, that I'm currently working on in my free time.
