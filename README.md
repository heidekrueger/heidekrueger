I'm a PhD student at TU Munich, doing research at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory and Market Design.
Particularly, I'm interested in the application of Deep Multiagent Reinforcement Learning methods to compute market equilibria, especially in auctions, and the mathematical underpinnings this entails.

Currently, most of my recent coding projects live in private repositories, but more and more of them should appear here soon.

### My Stack

I'm passionate about (and have long-term professional experience) the following frameworks:

* `pytorch` for deep learning (and other GPU-accelerated scientific computing).
* `python` for general software development.
* The `tidyverse` in `R` for data analysis and vizualisation.

In the past, I've also worked on Big Data with `spark` and `scala` and written simulations with `MATLAB` and code with `Java`, `C#` and `C++`.
