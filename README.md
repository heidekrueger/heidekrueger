## Hi, I'm Stefan ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about using math, algorithms and data to enable smarter decision making, whether in business, policy or our private lives.
Currently, I'm a Computer Science PhD student at TU Munich, doing research at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Algorithmic Game Theory and Microeconomics.
In my research, I study applications of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning methods to compute nontrivial market equilibria, especially in auctions, and the mathematical underpinnings this entails. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist in the telecomunications industry after earning my BSc and MSc degrees in applied Mathematics.

My expected graduation date for my PhD program is Fall/Winter 2022. After that I will be looking for Research Scientist / Research Engineer / AI Engineer / ML Engineer or (product-focused!) Data Scientist positions in industry.
I'm currently located in Munich, Germany. Primarily, I'm looking for positions that are local or remote/hybrid, but I'm willing to relocate within Europe for the right opportunity.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hdkrgr), connect with [me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidekrueger/) or check out [my academic profile at TUM](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/dss/members/stefan-heidekrueger/).

In my free time, I enjoy making music (I'm a drummer in a band and play some guitar on my own), and exploring the beer gardens, lakes (via SUP) and mountains (via Snowboard) around Munich.

## My Stack

I'm passionate about (and have several years of professional experience in) the following frameworks:

* `pytorch` for deep learning -- and GPU-accelerated scientific computing in general.
* The `tidyverse` in `R` (e.g. `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `purrr`, ...) for data analysis, vizualisation and statistical programming, as well as `mlr3` and `tidymodels` for meta-ml in R. 
* `python` for general software development. (I'm well versed in the Scipy stack for Data Science/ML (`numpy`, `scipy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `plotnine`,...), and have also worked on a few web apps in Django.

In the past, I've also worked on deep learning with `TensorFlow` and `keras`, Big Data with `spark` and `scala`, built Dashboards and data-centric WebApps using `Tableau` or `RShiny`, and written general-purpose code in `Java`, `C#` and `C++`, as well as some simulations with `MATLAB`. I know my way around `Unix` systems and `git`, I strive to write clean, performant, maintainable and we'll-documented code, and to follow DevOps best practices. I'm familiar with `GitHub`/ `GitLab` workflows and CI tools (especially `GitLab CI`). I have also worked extensively with RDBMSs (`MySQL`, `Postgres`, `MS SQL`, `Oracle`) in large DWH environments, and the cloud (mostly on AWS (EC2, S3, R53, AWS-CLI, SES, SageMaker, Lambda), but also some Azure).

Some technlogies I would love to check out in more detail, but haven't yet had a chance to work with extensively: `JAX` for differential programming; the `julia` project for statistical computing.


### If you're a potential employer who wants to see my code:

A good start would be `bnelearn`, a python library for equilibrium computation in Bayesian games that I originally developed during my PhD, and that I now maintain together with multiple collaborators. The library contains highly performant parallel implementations of many markets studied in the Auction Theory literarture, and it has enabled research that has appeared in journals such as _Nature Machine Intelligence_, the _INFORMS Journal on Computing_, and AI conferences like AAMAS and AAAI. You can find the latest public release at https://github.com/heidekrueger/bnelearn.

I also encourage you to also check out [my solutions](https://github.com/heidekrueger/f00b4r-Challenge) to Google's semi-secret foo-bar recruiting challenge, that I finished recently. (Levels 4.1 and 4.2 are a good place to start.)
