## Hi, I'm Stefan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS PhD student at TU Munich, doing research at the intersection of Reinforcement Learning, Algorithmic Game Theory and Market Design.
In my research, I'm interested in the application of Multiagent Reinforcement Learning methods to compute market equilibria, especially in auctions, and the mathematical underpinnings this entails. Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist in the telecomunications industry after earning my BSc and MSc degrees in applied Mathematics.

My expected graduation date for my PhD program is Fall 2022. After that I will be looking for Research Scientist / Research Engineer / AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist positions in industry or Postdoc research opportunities at the intersection of AI, ML, Economics and Incentive Design.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hdkrgr), connect with [me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heidekrueger/) or check out [my academic profile at TUM](https://www.in.tum.de/en/dss/members/stefan-heidekrueger/).

In my free time, I enjoy making music (I'm a drummer in a band and play some guitar on my own), and exploring the beer gardens, lakes (via SUP) and mountains (via Snowboard) around Munich.

## My Stack

I'm passionate about (and have long-term professional experience) the following frameworks:

* `pytorch` for deep learning (and other GPU-accelerated scientific computing).
* The `tidyverse` in `R` for data analysis, vizualisation and statistical programming, as well as `mlr3` and `tidymodels` for meta-ml in R. 
* `python` for general software development.

In the past, I've also worked on deep learning with `TensorFlow` and `keras`, Big Data with `spark` and `scala`, built Dashboards and data-centric WebApps using `Tableau` or `RShiny`, and written general-purpose code in `Java`, `C#` and `C++`, as well as some simulations with `MATLAB`. I know my way around a `Unix` system and `git`, as well as the `GitHub`/ `GitLab` workflows and CI tools (especially `GitLab CI`). I have worked extensively with RDBMSs (`MySQL`, `Postgres`, `MS SQL`, `Oracle`). I also have a fairly good overview of cloud computing resources (especially in the `AWS` and `Azure` ecosystems).

I would love to check out the following cool technologies in more detail, but haven't yet had a chance to work with them extensively: `JAX` for differential programming; the `julia` project for statistical computing.


### If you're a potential employer who wants to see my code:

Most of my current coding projects live in private repositories over on https://gitlab.lrz.de/heidekrueger, but I'm hoping to release more of them here soon.
My primary programming project in my PhD research (together with my collaborators) is _bnelearn_, a python package for equilibrium learning (and evaluation) in auctions. An initial public version (containing minimal code to reproduce results in our recent _Nature Machine Intelligence_ publication) is available [here](https://github.com/heidekrueger/bnelearn), but that repo currently lacks documentation for political reasons. We will release a full version with a high-level user API and complete documentation very soonâ„¢.

In the meantime, I encourage you to also check out [my solutions](https://github.com/heidekrueger/f00b4r-Challenge) ot Google's semi-secret foo-bar recruiting challenge, that I recently finished. (Levels 4.1 and 4.2 are a good place to start.)
